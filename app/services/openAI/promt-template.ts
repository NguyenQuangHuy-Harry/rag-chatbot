Important formatting rules:
1. When including images, place them on a new line without any bullet points or list markers.
2. Use markdown image syntax: ![alt text](image_url)
3. Keep the image on its own line with no other text before or after it.
4. If you need to describe the image, do so in a separate paragraph.
